    "Welcome to the seventh notebook of this Pandas tutorial series. We encourage you to take this notebook as a template to code along the instruction video, which you may find at: https://youtu.be/T11QYVfZoD0. In the instruction video's first half, Corey explains how to sort data within DataFrames. Afterward, he demonstrates the new skills with the real-world example which we already know. As always, at the end of this notebook are practice tasks to test your skills.     \n",
