    "### Hey Techie,   \n",
    "Welcome to the final notebook of this Pandas tutorial series. We encourage you to take this notebook as a template to code along the instruction video, which you may find at: https://youtu.be/N6hyN6BW6ao. In the instruction video, Corey explains how to read and write different data formats using Pandas. To work with Excel files, you need to install the packages *xlwt* (https://pypi.org/project/xlwt/), *openpyxl* (https://pypi.org/project/openpyxl/), and *xlrd* (https://pypi.org/project/xlrd/) first - this is explained at 7:30 min. Please note that you can skip the part where Corey explains how to handle data from SQL databases (17:00-28:00 min.). As always, at the end, you may find some practice tasks.\n",

This dataset is stored under data/transaction_details.csv and contains transaction details of an online store from the end of 2010 to the end of 2011. First, the dataset has to be loaded. Thereby, four parameters of the read_csv method have to be adjusted: sep, na_values, parse_dates, and date_parser. After the dataset has been loaded, all rows should be removed where both the CustomerID and Description column contain NaN values. The DataFrame should be saved as *df*.   \n",
